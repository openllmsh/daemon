# OpenLLM installer — installs the local daemon (openllmd) AND the CLI
# (openllm, plus the `ollm` alias). A daemon service starts only when a usable
# API key is already supplied or persisted. For a keyless install the script does
# not reimplement onboarding — on a controlling terminal it hands straight off to
# `openllm start` (whose credential gate prompts on /dev/tty); with no terminal it
# just prints the `openllm start` next step and exits zero.

# >>> openllm-env-lock/v1 (shared protocol — identical block in both >>>
# >>> installers; the SAME rules as packages/daemon/src/env.ts)        >>>
#
# The lock is the DIRECTORY "<envfile>.lock.d": `mkdir` is atomic on every
# POSIX filesystem (flock does not exist on macOS). Ownership is a record
# published atomically INSIDE the directory — written to `owner.tmp.$$`
# then renamed to `owner`:
#
#   kind=openllm-env-lock/v1 pid=<pid> start=<start identity> nonce=<hex>
#
# `start` is the owner's canonical start identity, the same value the
# daemon's `processStartIdentity` reads: on Linux the boot-scoped
# `boot:<boot_id>:<starttime ticks>` pair (built from
# /proc/sys/kernel/random/boot_id and field 22 of /proc/<pid>/stat, parsed
# after the last ') ' of the comm field); on macOS the `ps -o lstart=` text
# under LC_ALL=C TZ=UTC, whitespace collapsed to single spaces. It
# distinguishes a LIVE-but-reused pid from the real owner (PID reuse).
# Records written by older builds can carry the `ps lstart` text — a
# live-pid record in the other format is re-probed in the record's own
# format before it can convict — or `-` (an owner that could not read its
# own identity). `-` is never written by this build.
#
# A held lock is STALE only when its marked owner names a dead pid, or a
# live pid whose current start identity differs. A dir with no, unreadable
# or unmarked owner is HELD — but only inside a short "unproven" bound
# (OPENLLM_ENV_LOCK_ORPHAN_SECS, default 30 s): past it an ownerless dir
# (a holder killed between `mkdir` and publish) is reclaimed. A marked
# owner whose start is `-` can never be proven, so a live pid still holds
# it for the full stale window — a transient probe failure on the owner's
# side must never make a live lock reclaimable in seconds. The orphan bound
# still caps the legacy `.env.lock` FILE — an unprovable identity must not
# wedge the lock for the full stale window.
#
# Reclaim is MARK-FIRST. A contender that judges the dir stale drops a
# `steal.<pid>.<nonce>` marker INSIDE it (noclobber create), re-judges the
# SAME generation (inode match + the pre-mark mtime for the age term,
# since the marker create already bumped it), and only then `mv`s it to
# `.lock.stale.<pid>.<nonce>.<seq>`. The marker bridges the gap between the
# re-check and the move: a paused publisher that commits its owner record
# while a steal is in flight sees the marker (or the dir gone) and fails
# its own publish rather than holding a quarantined dir — two holders can
# never result. A steal that loses the rename (another contender moved
# first) or fails its re-check just drops its marker. Quarantine dirs are
# never moved back; a committed steal is final because publishers
# self-detect it. Old quarantine dirs are swept when their contents are
# only `owner.tmp.*`/`steal.*` residue (or empty) or a complete marked
# owner record.
#
# The publisher's veto is bound to the dir GENERATION, not the path: the
# inode of the just-`mkdir`'d dir is captured at acquire and re-stat'd
# after the record lands. A different inode — or a vanished dir — means
# this generation was quarantined and the path re-taken by a successor, so
# the publish drops its own record instead of writing into the
# successor's dir. A fresh unmarked dir is immovable (never stale, and a
# release only moves a dir that reads as its own), so the inode captured
# right after `mkdir` can only be ours.
#
# Release first reads the owner AT the live path and moves `.lock.d` to
# `.lock.rel.<pid>.<nonce>` ONLY when that record is marked with our nonce
# — a foreign marked owner (a successor that re-took the path after our
# dir was stolen) is never touched. The captured dir is then verified
# inside the quarantine: our nonce means delete; a foreign record means
# the path was swapped mid-move and the dir is put back NO-REPLACE — a
# fresh `mkdir` plus a verbatim copy of its flat files. `mv` could
# silently replace a successor's just-`mkdir`'d (still empty) dir that
# landed in the check->move gap; `mkdir` fails outright and the captured
# dir stays parked for the sweep instead.
#
# The pre-dir `.env.lock` FILE is still honoured for one release: HELD
# only inside the bounded orphan window — while a recorded pid is alive or
# its content is unparseable — and reclaimed past it even on a live pid.
# A dead-pid record is reclaimed ONLY by atomic rename to a unique
# quarantine name — the live path is never unlinked directly — then
# re-read there: a record that turns out to be live AND young is put back
# with a no-replace link, never over a successor lock file.

# --- provision the vendor subscription CLIs (opt-in, background) -----------
# The daemon RUNS the official vendor CLIs but never INSTALLS them (it runs
# under an OS sandbox that intentionally can't touch shell rc files). THIS
# script — run by the user, unsandboxed, with a real HOME/PATH/rc — is the one
# place a missing CLI can be installed. But a detached `curl | bash` against a
# third-party host is a real ask: it runs unverified code, inherits the
# installer's env (OPENLLM_API_KEY included), and historically had no timeout,
# no lock and no log bound (LEAK-1/2, RG-1, NET-5, SP-7). So it is OPT-IN:
#   OPENLLM_INSTALL_VENDOR_CLIS=1  → bounded background jobs for missing CLIs
#   default                       → print each vendor's official one-liner
#   OPENLLM_SKIP_VENDOR_CLIS=1    → hard no-op (CI/test harnesses — TEST-1)
# Opted-in jobs are launched WHOLE through `env -u <every exported OPENLLM_*>`
# so no intermediate process ever holds the API key, run under
# `timeout -k 15 600` — or a process-group watchdog that kills the job's own
# process group (setsid on Linux, `set -m` on macOS) where timeout(1) doesn't
# exist — fetch only over https with --proto-redir + connect/total curl
# deadlines, take a per-vendor pid+start-identity pidfile lock so re-runs
# never double-start, and stream their output through a bounded writer into
# a size-capped per-vendor log under ~/.openllm/cli-install/.
