/**
 * Behavior-neutral coordinator for resolving a host CLI candidate that may be
 * a version-manager shim (e.g. mise) rather than an ordinary executable.
 *
 * This module is ADDITIVE and, with zero adapters registered, is a pure
 * passthrough: `resolveManagerCandidate` returns the ordinary candidate
 * unchanged. It exists so a later adapter (mise, asdf, …) can be registered
 * without touching `cli-paths.ts` / `cli-install.ts` call sites again.
 *
 * Scope contract (see execution plan): resolution never inspects request- or
 * cwd-scoped state — it must select the same target regardless of the
 * daemon process's current working directory (global manager semantics).
 * Adapters run with a short bounded timeout, explicit argv only (no shell),
 * and must reject cyclic / self-referential / relative output.
