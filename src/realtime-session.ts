/**
 * ONE vendor realtime (voice) session — the local-only counterpart to
 * `image-walker.ts` / `video-walker.ts`, but duplex and long-lived instead of
 * request/response. Dials the provider's realtime WebSocket using the
 * delegate's `credentialForRealtime` (never a fabricated/exported token),
 * forwards the already-schema-validated client-event subset upstream
 * verbatim, and normalizes vendor events back through
 * `parseRealtimeServerEvent` before handing them to the caller — an
 * unrecognized vendor event is DROPPED, never relayed blind.
 *
 * Transport-agnostic on purpose: `realtime-handler.ts` adapts this to BOTH
 * the mux-serving path (browser/fleet via `TServeRealtime`) and the local
 * authenticated `/v1/realtime` WebSocket (non-browser loopback clients) —
 * one session core, two consumer transports. Putting the cloud
 * plan/policy gate (below) HERE, not in either transport adapter, is what
 * makes both transports share exactly one entitlement check — a browser
 * reaching this daemon over the mux/relay path is held to the SAME
 * account/model gate a same-machine 307 or the local-first-gateway direct
 * path enforces (`fetchPlan` + `planSignatureOk`, `walker.ts`); neither
 * transport can reach the vendor dial without passing it.
 *
 * No live network call happens anywhere in this module's OWN test suite —
 * `setRealtimeUpstreamFactory` swaps in a fake socket and
 * `setRealtimePlanCheckerForTests` swaps in a fake policy decision.
 * Production dials the real vendor URL/headers the delegate mints; this
 * daemon never constructs that URL itself (no arbitrary upstream targets).
 * The closing `report(...)` call's own network write (`recordRequest`,
 * `walker.ts`) is fire-and-forget exactly like every other subscription
 * surface's usage row — this module's tests don't mock it, matching
 * `audio-walker.ts`/`image-walker.ts`'s existing test convention.
