/**
 * In-memory pending device-code auth, per provider.
 *
 * When a delegate starts a device-code flow on a REMOTE daemon (codex /
 * kimi), the box that runs it isn't where the user's browser is — so the
 * verification URL + one-time code must reach the dashboard. The delegate
 * stashes them here; the daemon's STATUS push surfaces them (as the
 * connection `detail`) so the user can open the URL and authorize from their
 * own machine. Cleared when the credential lands (status sees `connected`) or
 * the flow is abandoned/expires.
 *
 * In-memory only — a daemon restart drops it and a fresh Connect re-creates
 * it. Not a secret (a device code is single-use + short-lived), so no
 * persistence and nothing sensitive is held.
