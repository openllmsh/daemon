/**
 * Codex bridge-capture tool turns + history inject (W6 / P3–P4).
 *
 * Builds on the isolated text capture path:
 *   - `dynamicTools` are registered so the vendor-constructed `/responses`
 *     envelope carries caller tool schemas (hosted `web_search` collision
 *     still suppressed — see {@link suppressHostedSearchClientTool}).
 *   - The loopback receiver captures that envelope; the builder never sees
 *     the true upstream response and never executes `item/tool/call`.
 *   - Daemon decodes Responses tool/argument/reasoning events directly.
 *   - Interrupt order: settle builder → record terminal → publish chunks.
 *
 * `thread/inject_items` is the LIVE-proven multi-turn feed for the exact
 * shape tested: one prior assistant tool-call + its matching tool-result,
 * fed via `thread/inject_items` ahead of a real `turn/start`, against real
 * app-server 0.156.0 with production ChatGPT auth and a real upstream
 * `/responses` round trip (no fake builder, no fake sender) —
 * `/tmp/openllm-capture-live.43ljY8/result-28-chatgpt-bridge-capture-tool.json`
 * (real tool call issued) →
 * `result-29-chatgpt-bridge-capture-tool-followup.json` (real follow-up turn,
 * `finish_reason: "stop"`, non-empty billed usage, no truncation). See
 * {@link CODEX_STRUCTURED_INJECT_LIVE_PROVEN} for the exact proven scope —
 * it does NOT cover reasoning items, multiple simultaneous tool calls, or
 * cache-affinity guarantees across turns; those remain unproven and reasoning
 * injection still refuses explicitly (see `codexHistoryToResponsesItems`).

/**
 * Hermetic fixture + schema-faithful wrapper prove inject appends history
 * without starting a user turn or executing tools. LIVE proof (real
 * app-server 0.156.0, production ChatGPT auth, real upstream `/responses`,
 * no fake builder/sender) additionally confirms the injected
 * `function_call` + `function_call_output` pair reaches the real vendor turn
 * and the model correctly answers using that injected result end-to-end:
 *
 *   - `result-28-chatgpt-bridge-capture-tool.json` — real tool call issued
 *     by the model (`noop_ping`, real `call_id`), captured, daemon-owned
 *     (never executed by the builder)
 *   - `result-29-chatgpt-bridge-capture-tool-followup.json` — the SAME
 *     `call_id` + the caller-supplied tool result injected via
 *     `thread/inject_items` into a FRESH isolated thread, followed by a real
 *     `turn/start`; the model replied `TOOL_DONE` /
 *     `finish_reason: "stop"` with billed, non-empty usage (12722 in / 7
 *     out / 2432 cached) — proof the injected pair was accepted as genuine
 *     turn history by the real backend, not merely echoed back unparsed.
 *
 * PROVEN SCOPE ONLY (do not read beyond this without new evidence):
 *   - ONE assistant tool-call + its ONE matching tool-result, injected once,
 *     immediately followed by a delta turn.
 *   - Plain-text follow-up turn (no further tool calls in the follow-up).
 *
 * NOT proven — still treat as open:
 *   - Reasoning items in history (`reasoningItems`/`reasoningContent`):
 *     `codexHistoryToResponsesItems` still THROWS on bare
 *     `reasoning_content` without opaque `reasoningItems`, and even opaque
 *     `reasoningItems` round-tripping has no live confirmation. Do not relax
 *     that refusal from this proof.
 *   - Multiple simultaneous / multiple sequential tool calls in one inject.
 *   - Cache-affinity / `prompt_cache_key` stability across an injected
 *     multi-turn conversation beyond this one single-hop case (the observed
 *     `cached_tokens: 2432` on the follow-up is consistent with cache reuse,
 *     but a single data point is not a general affinity guarantee).
 *   - Any transport other than the one exercised (HTTP or WS — the live runs
 *     did not pin which transport app-server chose for either attempt).
 *
 * Classification (do not collapse these):
 * - HERMETIC: fixture/wrapper contract proven in tests only.
 * - LIVE: proven for the exact scope above against the real vendor backend.
 * Production planning uses LIVE. Fixtures alone are never sufficient to flip
 * `CODEX_STRUCTURED_INJECT_LIVE_PROVEN` — this flip required the two live
 * attempts above.
