/**
 * Claude `sdk-facade` — the Hermes-inspired native stream-json completion
 * facade (plan phase 6 / H1-H3,
 * `docs/plan/bridge-variants-and-capture-adapters/12-hermes-adoption-plan.md`).
 * Distinct from BOTH existing Claude paths:
 *
 *   - `stream-json` (`claude-native.ts`) feeds ONE text turn via `--resume`
 *     and a single buffered stdin write; no caller tools.
 *   - `agent-sdk` (`claude-tool-session.ts`) drives the official
 *     `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk` `query()` and HOLDS it open across
 *     tool round-trips.
 *
 * `sdk-facade` instead replays the ENTIRE canonical history as FRAMED
 * `--input-format stream-json` lines on every turn (Hermes §3.B: "structured
 * full-history replay") and spawns a FRESH, STATELESS `claude` child each
 * time — `--no-session-persistence`, no `--resume`. There is no vendor
 * session and no daemon-held query to partition by execution identity
 * (00-requirements.md req. 5: no new conversation identifier) — the
 * client's own full message history IS the correlation, exactly like an
 * ordinary OpenAI-shaped completion call.
 *
 * History → frames reuses the SAME exact, non-lossy decomposition every
 * other Claude tool path already uses — `request-capture-history.ts`'s
 * `historyTurnsFromCanonicalMessages` and `claude-tool-capture.ts`'s
 * `anthropicMessagesFromHistoryTurns`/`buildClaudeToolNameMap` — rather than
 * a parallel history planner (00-requirements.md req. 3).
 *
 * Replay protocol (Hermes §3.B) — role-specific, matching the reference
 * implementation exactly (`tmp/hermes-claude-sdk-reference/directsdk.py:581-595`):
 * ONLY a `type:"user"` frame that is not the last frame is written with
 * `shouldQuery: false` and MUST be acknowledged by a zero-turn `result` line
 * before the next frame is sent. A `type:"assistant"` historical frame (any
 * prior assistant/tool-use turn) is written and NEVER waited on — the
 * installed CLI appends it to conversation state silently, with no ack and
 * no error, and only ever resumes generation on the next `type:"user"` frame
 * that omits `shouldQuery`. The final frame (always `type:"user"` — history
 * decomposition guarantees a trailing user/tool-result turn) omits
 * `shouldQuery` and is the turn's ONE real model call — replay itself makes
 * no network request (Hermes §3.E: admission is a transport invariant;
 * `sdk-facade-capture` in `claude-sdk-facade-capture.ts` relies on exactly
 * this to intercept only that one call).
 *
 * **Earlier adaptation error (corrected):** a prior version of
 * {@link planClaudeSdkFacadeTurn} assigned `shouldQuery: false` to EVERY
 * non-final frame regardless of role, including `type:"assistant"` frames.
 * Because {@link replayClaudeSdkFacadeHistory} waits for an ack whenever
 * `shouldQuery === false`, that misassignment made the replay loop wait for
 * an acknowledgment the CLI never sends for an assistant frame — a genuine
 * hang bound only by `PRE_COMMIT_TIMEOUT_MS`. A guard
 * (`sdkFacadeRequiresUnsupportedAssistantReplay`) was added to refuse any
 * plan containing an assistant frame before ever spawning the CLI, avoiding
 * the hang but also blocking every ordinary multi-turn or tool-continuation
 * request — a correctness bug in the adaptation, not a genuine CLI
 * limitation, per the reference source above (only `type:"user"` frames are
 * ever assigned `shouldQuery: false`; `type:"assistant"` frames are appended
 * unconditionally with no ack expectation at all).
 *
 * **H1 real-CLI construction proof (verified against the real installed
 * `claude` binary, not merely `--help`-inferred or the reference source
 * alone):** `tests/transport/claude-sdk-facade-real-cli-construction.e2e.test.ts`
 * (opt-in, `RUN_DAEMON_LIVE=1`, real installed `claude` binary, dummy API
 * key, no login, no network — either no request at all for the local ack
 * accounting, or a local mock upstream for the one real dispatch) now
 * proves the CORRECTED protocol end to end:
 *
 *   - A `type:"user"` `shouldQuery:false` frame DOES receive a zero-turn
 *     `result` line (`num_turns: 0`) before the next write.
 *   - A `type:"assistant"` frame written WITHOUT `shouldQuery` (the fixed
 *     construction) produces no ack and no error, exactly as expected — the
 *     replay loop does not wait on it, so there is nothing to hang on.
 *   - A genuine multi-turn history (system + user + assistant + user, with
 *     unique per-turn sentinel text) reaches the production dispatch
 *     function (`runClaudeSdkFacadeCapture`) exactly ONCE, and the
 *     captured body's `messages` array is the ORDERED `[user, assistant,
 *     user]` triple with each turn's own sentinel in the right slot and no
 *     other turn's sentinel bled into it (not merely "the text appears
 *     somewhere in the body") — proof against missing, reordered, or
 *     duplicated turns.
 *   - Separately, a tool_use/tool_result continuation (assistant `tool_use`
 *     for a declared caller tool + a `tool_result` user turn, both non-final
 *     history frames) reaches the same production function exactly once,
 *     and the captured `tool_use` block carries the CLI's own
 *     `mcp__openllm__`-prefixed wire name plus the original call id and
 *     parsed input, while the `tool_result` block carries the original id
 *     and content.
 *   - Separately again, `runClaudeSdkFacade` — the NORMAL, non-capture
 *     production path, not just the capture-interception path — replays the
 *     same multi-turn history against a real local fake `/v1/messages` SSE
 *     upstream and produces a COMMITTED run whose output matches that
 *     upstream's scripted completion, with the upstream's own captured
 *     request confirming the full history reached it.
 *
 * All of the above is CONSTRUCTION/SHAPE proof — the exact bytes this
 * facade builds are ones the real installed CLI accepts and threads through
 * correctly against a local mock upstream — never proof of correctness
 * under genuine AUTHENTICATED inference, a different installed CLI version,
 * or real network conditions (H6, separately tracked, still unattempted).
 * On that evidence, `sdkFacadeRequiresUnsupportedAssistantReplay` and its
 * refusal have been removed — the shape it blocked was never actually
 * unsupported by the CLI, only mis-encoded by this facade. See
 * 09-implementation-plan.md §13b for the corrected execution-status
 * wording.
 *
 * Streaming output reuses `@openllmsh/wire`'s
 * `fromAnthropicStreamEvent`/`newAnthropicStreamState` UNCHANGED — the same
 * `--include-partial-messages` NDJSON shape `claude-native.ts` already
 * decodes — with `toolNameMap` wired so a caller `tool_use` block decodes
 * under its ORIGINAL name, never the MCP-prefixed one. Caller tools are
 * declared (schema only) via `claude-facade-mcp-server.ts`'s loopback MCP
 * server; the model's `tool_use` block ends the turn (`--max-turns 1`)
 * before the CLI would ever actually invoke a tool — caller tools stay
 * caller-owned (00-requirements.md req. 6).
