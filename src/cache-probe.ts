/**
 * §4.1 cache-race probe — telemetry for
 * docs/proposals/claude-code-cache-rebuild-waste.md.
 *
 * Confirms or refutes the "concurrent-request cache racing" hypothesis for the
 * repeated ~330k `cache_creation_tokens` rebuilds seen in dev-DB usage: two
 * requests that share a prompt-cache prefix dispatch within seconds of each
 * other, each sees the prefix's cache write uncommitted, and BOTH pay the full
 * write. The probe is METADATA ONLY — it hashes a canonical-serialised body
 * prefix (never logs content) and counts how many requests sharing that
 * prefix were already awaiting upstream when this one dispatched. It wraps
 * ONLY the manual Anthropic transport dispatch (the claude_code manual path);
 * the native runtime is upstream of the hop and never reaches it, and
 * non-Anthropic wires are excluded.
 *
 * OFF by default — gated on `OPENLLM_CACHE_PROBE=1` so a production daemon is
 * completely unaffected; flip it only while collecting the race correlation,
 * then delete the probe once the hypothesis is settled.

 * excluded because it is the fresh, uncached delta. For a chatgpt/Responses
 * body the analog is `instructions` + all-but-last `input` item. Hashing the
 * JSON of those fields means: two requests that share their stable prefix
 * collide on `prefix_hash`; a request whose prefix grew/diverged does not.
