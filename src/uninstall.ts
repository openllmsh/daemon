/**
 * `openllmd uninstall` — remove the OpenLLM DAEMON from this machine. It owns
 * only the daemon's own teardown; the CLI owns its own (`openllm uninstall`),
 * which delegates here first and then removes the CLI surface. So this leaves
 * CLI-owned state (the client ledgers, the `openllm` binary, run dir) in place.
 *
 * Order matters — we STOP the self-restoring service FIRST (so launchd /
 * systemd can't relaunch the daemon mid-teardown), then delete daemon state:
 *
 *   1. confirm (destructive + irreversible — daemon credentials are deleted)
 *   2. stop + unregister the background service (launch agent / systemd unit)
 *   3. remove shell completion (rc line + fish file)
 *   4. remove the `openllmd` PATH symlink (only if it's ours)
 *   5. delete DAEMON state under `~/.openllm` — the `openllmd` binary, paired
 *      API key, encryption keypair, sessions, logs — while PRESERVING CLI-owned
 *      entries (see `CLI_OWNED_ENTRIES`). OPTIONALLY also preserve
 *      `~/.openllm/cli` (the subscription logins) so a later reinstall reuses
 *      them instead of re-authenticating.
 *
 * The running process keeps executing from its already-loaded binary even
 * after its file is unlinked (the inode survives until exit), so deleting the
 * state dir from within is safe; we exit at the end.
