 * Final-only image SSE for the local lane.

 * NEITHER subscription provider this walker serves emits progressive
 * image bytes — xAI's docs state streaming "is not supported by models
 * with image output capability", and the Gemini image wire documents no
 * partial-image events — so there is nothing real to forward as a
 * partial frame. Rather than refuse `stream: true` (the caller asked
 * for a transport, not a capability) or fabricate progress, this emits
 * exactly ONE genuine `image_generation.completed` event carrying the
 * real bytes, the real usage when the upstream sent one, and the
 * durable library URL.
 *
 * Ordering is the promise: persistence runs BEFORE the stream opens, so
 * a `completed` event is only ever written once the bytes are stored
 * and the `url` it advertises exists. A persistence failure therefore
 * answers a normal JSON error, never a `completed` event describing
 * media that was not saved.
 *
 * This DELIBERATELY differs from the cloud image lane, which opens the
 * stream first so genuine progressive frames can reach the client while
 * generation is still running, and persists when its completed event
 * arrives. That lane cannot persist first — it does not hold the final
 * image until the end, and buffering to get it would destroy the
 * progressive property it exists to provide; it therefore needs a
 * terminal SSE `error` frame for a post-open persistence failure, which
 * this lane never reaches for. Do not "harmonise" the two: each order
 * is correct for its inputs, and the invariant they share is the one
 * that matters — `url` is emitted only after the bytes are stored, so
 * on both lanes its presence is a fact rather than a promise.
