/**
 * Working-set FOUNDATIONS — shared helpers + the base grant set every daemon
 * sub-process layer sits on top of. See `./index.ts` for the composition and
 * `docs/proposals/daemon-subprocess-isolation.md` §3.1 for the layer split.
 *
 * This module holds the pieces that are NOT specific to any one sub-process
 * layer:
 *   - the `TWorkingSet` shape,
 *   - the path-safety helpers (`existing`, `SENSITIVE_ROOTS`) both layers and
 *     the sandbox backends rely on,
 *   - the dynamic vendor-CLI exec-dir resolver (`resolveCliExecDirs`) + the
 *     hardcoded vendor exec-dir floor (`vendorExecDirs`) — shared because BOTH
 *     the `auth-state` layer (login/usage delegation) and the
 *     `vendor-cli-tunnel` layer (device PTY sessions) exec the vendor CLIs,
 *   - `daemonTempDir`,
 *   - `baseWorkingSet()` — the state dir, the daemon-owned temp, the binary's
 *     own dir, `/dev`, and the read-only system trees: everything shared by all
 *     four layers (the parent supervisor lives here too).
 *
 * The layer modules (`auth-state.ts`, `browser-chat.ts`, `fleet.ts`,
 * `vendor-cli-tunnel.ts`) import from here; they NEVER import each other, so no
 * process can pull in another layer's working set (R2-T9).
 *
 * Original single-file rationale (2026-07-03 working-set-exposure audit
 * §5-A/B/C and the `daemon-os-sandbox-and-typed-control.md` §3.1 derivation)
 * moves here verbatim — it is load-bearing audit trail:
 *
 *   read-write
 *     - the state dir (`~/.openllm`): the shared .env (0600, holds the key + device
 *       id + config) and state.json, logs, the isolated vendor CLIs under `cli/<provider>/`
 *       (homes + binaries + config), AND the daemon binary itself + its
 *       atomic-swap temp (`bin/openllmd`, `.openllmd.update.<pid>.tmp` —
 *       the installer places the binary inside the state dir);
 *     - the executable's real directory (belt-and-braces when `execPath`
 *       lives outside the state dir — a manual install);
 *     - the claude XDG STATE + CACHE dirs (isolated claude writes these at run
 *       time on Linux; absent on macOS) — SCOPED to the claude subdirs;
 *     - bun's global install cache (`~/.bun/install/cache`) — the RW half of the
 *       split `~/.bun` grant (the bin dir is read+exec only).
 *
 *   read-only
 *     - the system trees the runtime + spawned tools (`bash`, `curl`, the
 *       vendor CLIs' loaders) need: `/usr`, `/lib*`, `/bin`, `/sbin`, `/opt`,
 *       `/etc` (resolv.conf + TLS trust), `/proc`, `/sys`, `/run`, `/var`;
 *     - the vendor-CLI binary dirs — READ+EXEC only (the daemon runs the CLIs
 *       but never installs or updates them; that is user-run + unsandboxed);
 *     - `~/.bun/bin` (exec `bun` — read+exec only, launcher-trojan guard).
 *
 *   deny (implicit — everything else, notably the rest of `$HOME`)
 *     - `~/.ssh`, `~/.aws`, `~/.gnupg`, browser profiles, documents,
 *       `~/.claude/.credentials.json`, the shell rc files (`~/.zshrc` etc.),
 *       and WRITES to the provider-CLI binary dirs.
 *
 * Note the system `/tmp` is deliberately NOT granted (granting it would leak
 * every other process's temp files — and the user unit no longer sets
 * `PrivateTmp=yes`, which broke `--user` units). Instead the daemon owns
 * `<state>/tmp` (`daemonTempDir()`, granted as part of the state dir) and
 * points every isolated CLI's `TMPDIR` at it (`cli-paths.ts` `cliEnv`), so the
 * codex/kimi installers' `mktemp -d` stages inside the working set rather than
 * EACCESing on the ungranted `/tmp`.

/**
 * Resolve the directories a spawned vendor CLI must be able to READ+EXEC, by
 * FOLLOWING the launcher's symlink chain from `seed`. The daemon execs the
 * launcher and the kernel reads THROUGH every symlink to the real ELF, so each
 * dir along the way must be granted or the spawn EACCESes. Hardcoding these is
 * brittle — each vendor buries its real binary in a different, sometimes
 * version-specific, dir (claude `~/.local/share/claude/versions/<v>`, codex
 * `~/.codex/packages/standalone/releases/<v>-<arch>/bin` behind a `current` DIR
 * symlink, grok `~/.grok/downloads/grok-<arch>` behind `~/.grok/bin/grok`), and
 * a custom install dir (`GROK_BIN_DIR`, `CODEX_HOME`, …) moves them anywhere.
 * Following the ACTUAL chain is self-correcting.
 *
 * Two passes, both needed:
 *   1. per-hop walk (`lstat`→`readlink`) collecting `dirname()` of every node —
 *      catches FILE-symlink chains;
 *   2. `dirname(realpath(seed))` — catches INTERMEDIATE DIR symlinks a file walk
 *      steps over (codex's `current → releases/<v>`).
 *
 * Each collected dir is emitted in BOTH forms — the canonical (realpath'd) path
 * AND the RAW path as the chain spells it. The two backends enforce on different
 * things: Landlock resolves a rule to an INODE, so the canonical form is the only
 * one that matters, but macOS Seatbelt matches the PATH the kernel walks, and
 * that walk must be able to `stat()` every intermediate component AS WRITTEN.
 * Canonicalizing codex's `~/.codex/packages/standalone/current/bin` to its
 * `releases/<v>-<arch>/bin` target silently dropped the `current` symlink node
 * from the profile, so `seatbelt.ts`'s `homeAncestorPaths` never emitted a
 * metadata literal for it and every `codex` spawn — plus the `existsSync` probe
 * behind `cli_installed` — EPERM'd at that node, surfacing in the dashboard as
 * "ChatGPT (Codex) CLI not found on this machine" on a box where codex WAS
 * installed (audit `2026-07-25-codex-exec-dir-symlink-seatbelt.md`). Emitting the
 * raw path too keeps the ancestor walk honest; on Linux it is a duplicate rule
 * for the same inode, which Landlock ignores.
 *
 * SECURITY: emits READ+EXEC dir grants only (binaries, never credentials — auth
 * stores like `~/.grok/auth.json` are SIBLINGS, not under any bin/downloads
 * dir). Every candidate must EXIST and must not be `/`, `$HOME`, an ancestor of
 * `$HOME`, or a bare `SENSITIVE_ROOTS` entry — checked in BOTH forms, so neither
 * a raw nor a canonical bare/broken/hostile chain can widen the grant onto the
 * home tree, the filesystem root, or a secret-bearing root. All fs reads are
 * best-effort: a missing/broken/looping link just stops the walk with whatever
 * was safely collected (never throws).
