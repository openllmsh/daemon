/**
 * `auth & state` sub-process layer — vendor CLI delegation: login flows,
 * credential capture, usage reads, the Keychain dance. This layer owns
 * essentially ALL of the daemon's filesystem-secret grants: the isolated vendor
 * CLI homes + keychain-adjacent config under the state dir, and READ+EXEC of the
 * vendor binaries it spawns.
 *
 * Returns ONLY this layer's UNIQUE grants — the shared state dir, temp, `/dev`,
 * and system read trees live in `base.ts`. `index.ts` unions the two. The whole
 * `state` dir (which holds `<state>/cli/<provider>/**`) is granted by the base
 * for M1.5 union parity; when the `--sub auth` subprocess drops the base's broad
 * `state` grant (R2-M2), the `<state>/cli` slice moves here.
 *
 * See `docs/proposals/daemon-subprocess-isolation.md` §3.1 (`auth` row).
