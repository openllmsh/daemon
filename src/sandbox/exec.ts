/**
 * Per-child OS sandboxing — the ONE module that knows about the
 * `openllmd --sandbox-exec -- <argv…>` self-re-exec shim
 * (`docs/audits/daemon-sandbox-scoping.md` §2). It owns three things:
 *
 *   - `sandboxSpawnArgs()` — the call-site entry point: wrap a child argv so
 *     the child runs confined. Pure argv-in/argv-out; call sites contain no
 *     platform checks, no gate checks, no verb knowledge.
 *   - `runSandboxExec()` — the `--sandbox-exec` verb handler (`cli.ts`
 *     delegates here): apply the working-set sandbox to THIS re-exec'd
 *     process (`applyDaemonSandbox({ force: true })` — inherited by the tail
 *     command), spawn the tail with inherited stdio, and mirror its exit.
 *   - the env-gate logic (kill switch + dev-source opt-in), resolved in one
 *     place.
 *
 * The daemon process itself is NOT sandboxed (device-session PTYs must run
 * the user's real CLI over their real files); each risky child is confined at
 * spawn time instead. Fail-open lives HERE and in the shim, nowhere else:
 * when sandboxing is off/unsupported the wrap is an identity passthrough and
 * a shim whose apply degrades still runs the child — surfaced loudly
 * per-spawn (stderr + `logWarn` in `runSandboxExec`) on top of the boot-time
 * capability posture (`probeSandboxCapability`).

 * (`~/.openllm/cli/<p>/home/.codex`, `.kimi-code`, `.grok/auth.json`). The

 * value at wrap time and the shim threads it into the working set — the tail
 * still runs with the isolated `HOME` it was given.
 *
