/**
 * Sub-method capability table + per-hop selection — the ONE home for
 * "which execution methods does each subscription provider support, and
 * which one does this hop use?".
 *
 * `bridge` = the native vendor-runtime path (`native-runtime/`);
 * `bridge-capture` = the same native path with vendor-built request capture
 * (daemon owns the one upstream exchange — see
 * `docs/plan/bridge-request-capture/`);
 * `handrolled` = the walker's manual upstream-HTTP transport. The cloud
 * publishes a preference in the bootstrap snapshot
 * (`config.ts#activeSubMethod` + per-provider
 * `config.ts#activeSubMethodOverrides`, both from the cloud env
 * `ACTIVE_SUB_METHOD`); the walker passes `overrides[provider] ?? global`
 * as `requested`, and selection resolves it against the provider's
 * declared methods:
 *
 *   selected = requested !== null && methods.includes(requested)
 *     ? requested
 *     : methods[0];               // provider default (array-index-0)
 *
 * The walker samples the selection ONCE per hop, before local execution:
 * `handrolled` never probes or spawns the bridge; `bridge` /
 * `bridge-capture` keep the pre-commit decline → manual fallback on the
 * same hop when declared. See `docs/proposals/active-sub-method.md` +
 * `docs/proposals/sub-method-simplified-execution.md`.
 *
 * `bridge-capture` is declared for Claude/Codex native request capture,
 * Cursor's ACP/Connect capture, and Muse's native endpoint-transport capture.
 * Declaration enables selection; it does not certify every live scenario.
 * Only providers without that declaration normalize a capture override to
 * `methods[0]`; see the capture live-validation report for tested coverage.
